# Bio modification

The Fleshwarpers are a deviant branch of the [Biocrafters](Biocrafters.qmd) that have forsaken the ethical principle that prohibits the twisting of flesh and bone and embrace the mediums of muscle and sinew to create bio augmentations, tools, and even vehicles that rely on flesh.

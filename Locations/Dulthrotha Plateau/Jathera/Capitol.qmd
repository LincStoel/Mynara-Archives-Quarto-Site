# A City Built Anew

Post revolution Jathera burned the shrines of oppression that housed the aristocracy and used the valuable trade goods gathered from their destruction to fund the construction of a new capital city. Over time, as their nation grew powerful, Capitol spread across the countryside. Surrounding farmland with city blocks, connecting the hamlets and towns of the countryside with cobblestone roads, the nation now resembles one sprawling city with the lines that delineate boroughs left as the only remnants that the cities are distinct from one another. Of course this city does not span the nation coast to coast, but from within it seems endless.

# A Dotted Landscape

Hjelld is an island with an overabundance of leyline springs. Scholars often venture to this land to study the magical phenomenon, and study to stories of the Lutheran priests that dwell in the islands many temples. Adventurers venture to this land to test their mettle against the empowered guardians that walk the landscape. Because the springs are not harnessed by civilization the creatures born and weaned of their waters grow powerful and wild. 

While there are signs of civilization across this island the villages are most often self sufficient and agrarian.

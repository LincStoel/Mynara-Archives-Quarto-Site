    "text": "The Beginning\n36 town folk including yourselves have journeyed up this mountainside along side the deputy ranger of Veridia Jurga Taff. Jurga is a gruff battle weary elf from where the ground stays frozen year round and your only chance of making it out of this journey alive. She has been tracking the beast for months; she’s followed up on leads from survivors, tracked the creature’s path from the wreckage of merchant carts, and so on. What she knows for certain is that this is no bear. This monster that has slain dozens of travelers and looted caravans covered its tracks, gathered valuables, and left behind things that weren’t worth keeping. Many of the victims were killed, however the few survivors have reported kidnappings and a few have mentioned that it rambled at them in a language that they aren’t familiar with. Whatever this thing is, it is stealthy, inhumanly quick, large, and needs to be stopped. Given Jurga’s research she has deduced that this cave is where the beast lives, and the corpses impaled on the stalagmites just inside its mouth. The stench of death wafts out from the dark hole in the mountain and causes your stomach to turn. Jurga groups you into squads of 4 and instructs you all to stick to the buddy system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurga’s Pep Talk\n\n\n\n“Weapons out, eyes open, one of you carries a source of light at all times. You are not rangers, you are townsfolk who know how to hold a weapon. Stick close with me and you all might just make it out of here in one piece. Remember, don’t be a hero. We strike together, we move together, and if someone gets separated from the group we do not go looking for them. everyone here has made this choice with the promise of glory and wealth at the end of this, but that is only a reward that those who survive will get a cut of. You all stand here for a moment while i go scout ahead and make sure that we aren’t walking into an ambush then when i give you the signal you follow.”\n\n\nAs Jurga breaks from the group and walks into the cave you feel a sense of dread in the air. The gravity of this situation sets in. Just before you lose sight of Jurga in the inky dark of the cave you hear a loud crack before Jurga falls from view in a cloud of debris. She lets out a yell that is cut off by the sound of a body being run through. One of your fellow townsfolk runs ahead to investigate and shouts back “she fell in a spike pit. She’s dead!” As they announce this several of your allies scatter, running away from the cave, some shake their heads and toss down their makeshift spears and pitch forks before tuning and leaving. Eventually it is only the 16 of you who remain."

This led to an era of lich kings tyrannically enslaving the living and harvesting corpses for their armies. Without a god’s aid to oppose this power Albrea sought aid in nature. Drawing upon the sun’s burning light Albrea dedicated herself to eradication of mindless undead in life and inspired a holy order of clerics to follow her into battle. Through her crusade she brought light across the world and brought balance back to the world of the living and undead. Followers of Albrea tolerate the existence of sentient undead, and hold a tenuous respect for those risen through #Teneth , but will eradicate creatures risen by #Nolduro on sight."

Once a vast city Ardensia spanned coast to coast on a larger island before an astral impact leveled most of the structures and caused great waves to wash away the city. A testament to what can be accomplished by the combined efforts of mortals and a well designed metropolis it is said that in their simultaneous deat the spirits of Adensians united in death and gave rise to the god of cities. Shortly after the fall of this great city mortals lurched forward in their colonization of the plane. Inspired by visions of a vast metropolis what were once small towns were spurred to expand. It is said that without Ardensia’s influence the mortals of the material plane would be nothing more that warring tribes. Ardensia’s clerics often find themselves as city planners, architects, and crafts folk dedicated to the growth and function of their city."

Dylgrac shields those who have fought bravely as they return home regardless of the side of the battle they fought on, it is not uncommon to see battlefield medics that venerate this god tending the wounds of hostile and allied fallen alike.

Lizbet’s clerics maintain that all material goods belong to Lizbet and mortals simply borrow them from her. For that reason, Lizbet’s clerics are best known for “reallocating” goods from those with means to those without with little regard for “ownership.” In their eyes all have equal claim to craft goods, with a notable exception for those who created the goods, and by stealing and gifting items they are acting as a distribution network for items. In addition to their common perception as thieves and nuisances they are also sought after for their unique skills in identifying the providence of items. They are knowledgeable in not only the origins of famous objects, but also are adept at seeking out the origins of objects. If you need to return something to someone, or identify if something is a forgery there is no better person to seek out than a cleric of Lizbet. Notably, the scourges that these clerics carry are the best identifier of those who devote themselves to Lizbet’s ideals. Clerics of Lizbet craft their Scourge from various Knick knacks and baubles that they come across in their travels. Each end of the scourge has a unique story as to why the cleric attached it to their weapon, but that story may be as simple as “I like the way it looks!”"

By carving and stitching them together Nolduro empowers his disciples with the power of gods. Creation of novel creatures from the raw materials of deceased creatures is an art reserved for mortals. Not only do these disciples create servitor beings they also augment their own bodies with undead prosthetics. Nolduro restricts the creation of undead to mortals and inhibits non mortal creatures from creating undead creatures. Before his ascension Nolduro was the first mortal on the material plane to master necromancy through study and practice without divine intervention. By perfecting this craft and focus on creation for creation’s sake upon his death his power spread throughout the plane seeding mortals forever with the latent ability to create undeath."

Ozoth often comes into conflict with the worshipers of other deities as it’s goals are myopic, wasteful, and selfish to a fault. However, Ozoth often finds champions in places of great need. When an individual is pushed to the brink of death, when they are the sole survivor and are not out of the woods yet this is when Ozoth comes to them. Ozoth pushes people to do the unthinkable. You are starving and can only survive by eating the corpses of your already dead children, you are backed into a corner and the only way out is by ripping them apart and frightening the rest with you brutality, you are at the mercy of worshipers of Ozoth and only by matching them can you survive. However, once welcomed in Ozoth does not easily release you. Even once free of the circumstances that led you to welcome Ozoth into your heart Ozoth drives you to consume, to conquer, to dominate until there is nothing left."

While yes, the pursuit of their craft is front and center they are equally as enthusiastic about helping others refine their craft and making their skills available to others. Scios disciples devote equal energy to celebration of craft as they do to the pursuit often holding great indulgent feasts, and parties to congratulate another craft person’s triumph. Some find it odd that miners often devote themselves to Scios, Scios does hold domain over earth after all, but it is worth drawing attention to how much of what artisans use to create comes from the earth! Smiths use the ore that is pulled from the ground, chefs use the food grown from the dirt, painters use dyes made from ground minerals, and sculptors not only use clay, but many of their glazes are drawn from earth as well! Miners, while masters of their own craft, mining, are a critical part of a craft person’s work and they command appropriate respect from any artisan who claims to hold themselves to Scios’ ideals."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Deep beyond the groves of trees in the highlands of Hjelld the Phantasm Forest rests holding the secrets of travelers safe until such a time they are required by another. It is said that there is no better way to learn if your traveling companions are reliable than to rest underneath the canopy of pale yellow leaves of these shimmering trees. As travelers pass through the woods they witness visions of the lives and memories of previous travelers while leaving impressions of their own behind. These echoes of time may reveal truths of the realm, or guide adventurers to long forgotten treasures of ages past. However, the forest gives as much as it takes and those who venture into the forest must be without secret or shame unless they would leave these thoughts behind for others to view. Over time as the memories of those who pass are concentrated within the leaves of these trees they are slowly transformed into parchment like sheets bearing tales of events long passed. The veins form lines of swirling text written in a language unique to the forest, and often adopted by those who study the arcane, that chronicle the memories contained within. These leaves are prized by mages and scholars for their magical properties and historical relevance respectively. One would think that these chronicles would be born of the recollection of a single individual, or jumbled inarticulate ramblings of several unrelated memories, however the forest seems to distribute the memories that are gathered in a sort of natural library. Before a leaf is released from the canopy the forest must be satisfied that a full telling of a story is captured, only then will the abscission of the leaf occur. The wood seldom bothers with malicious or magnanimous action, however a way to guarantee that your memories never escape the forest is to prematurely harvest a leaf from the boughs of the greenwood. If a leaf is pulled from it’s node before it’s tale is captured the very earth will quake as The Warden excises your soul from your flesh.\n\n\nRising high through the canopies stands a magnificent gnarled tree weaved from the boughs of numerous intertwined aspen known as the Warden of the Phantasm Forest. This central Godwood’s roots are the foundation that every tree in the wood grows from. The Warden stands in silent guardianship of the forest and will happily converse with travelers who seek guidance in good faith, but is equally eager to snuff the fire that burns within those who would do harm to the forest or interrupt their stories. As well as guardian, The Warden serves the additional role as the collector of the completed stories. As the leaves fall from the Phantasm Forest’s canopy they degrade and the knowledge is captured in the roots of The Warden. While the warden abhors the interruption of their stories, if a traveler gathers up fallen leaves and reads the text marked upon them The Warden is happy to move branches, uplift roots, and subtly manipulate the landscape to create a comfortable space to read. The bargain struck with The Warden in that moment that a leaf is gathered requires that once the reader has finished that the leaf be left behind among the underbrush of the forest. Unlike many guardians who came upon a spring and became enthralled by the power that it offers there is no surface geyser that the magic imbued water erupts from in this forest. That’s not to say that the shimmering pools of the forest aren’t imbued with their own power, it is that these pools were not exposed until the roots of the forest drank from the aquifer below. While it is impossible to know for certain, it is believed that this magical forest first came about when the roots of The Warden, before it was known as The Warden of course, first pulled the magic from the earth to the surface.\n\n\n\nAmong the trees of this magnificent forest reside a variety of creatures that co-exist in this safe place. Many animals who live within the forest find themselves awakened and gifted a foundation of memories from a benevolent traveler to build their understanding around. In more exceptional cases plants that are not integrated into the Warden’s root system find themselves similarly awakened. While not all awakened creatures are gifted with enlightened intellect those who know their language may find that even the lowliest of rodent has the capacity for more enlightened conversation. While The Warden is not all knowing within the bounds of it’s forest it is through the friendship with it’s denizens that it has eyes. Also among the underbrush are specters that, contrary to common wisdom, are not true ghosts. The distinction between these ghostly entities and true incorporeal undead is that these renderings do not have their origins in the realm of spirits and rather the realm of memories and the mind. Because the forest is less concerns with the actions of individuals than it is with events and narratives these “spirits” are not absorbed into The Warden’s collection. Particularly powerful memories of individuals can manifest as shimmering phantasms in their likeness as depicted by the memories of others. As you wander the grove you may find yourself face to face with heroes and leaders of nations, but not as they actually were rather finding them as how they were remembered.\n\n\n\nOnce manifested these phantasms take agency over their experience and the older phantasms may evolve and become unrecognizable from the memories that bore them. One may come across a specter that began as a leader of a nation, but now holds the visage of a humble rabbit. Or perhaps meet the menacing beast that came from a spirit once known best for its amenability. It is best not to treat the specters as recordings of individuals long passed but rather as their own entity.\n\n\n\nThose who wander may come across nourishing fruits of the forest. When presented with these gifts one is best to accept as the forest gives these gifts not only of fulfillment of body, but also of mind. Each berry, apple, or nettle is imbued with knowledge that The Warden has deemed you worthy of and when eaten will instantly grant you understanding. Occasionally these gifts contain the knowledge of how to approach the central clearing that The Warden inhabits So as to allow you a more extended audience with the forest. Without specific guidance from the forest even the most adept navigators will find themselves always on the edge of the warden’s glade but never able to peer within."

Many cursed in this way cover the eye with a bandana when they leave the house, however many report that if they leave the covered, with no predictability to it, the eye will cause a searing pain until the covering is removed. Many believe that when The Watchers chooses to peer through these growths and finds them darkened he induces this pain to clear its vision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Created with Stable Diffusion"

    "text": "Welcome to Veridia!\n\n\n\nWelcome to Veridia, a small city nestled in the highland cliffs and ancient woodlands of Kaldaria. Here, the heart of the town resonates with the harmonious blend of artistic mastery and the pursuit of knowledge. Veridia is renowned for its flourishing clay industry, where skilled artisans mold the rich earth into exquisite pottery and intricate sculptures. Travelers from all over go out of their way to tour the gorgeous architecture of the Academic college. Enveloped by lush gardens, and featuring magnificent sculptures, the college’s architecture beckons scholars and inquisitive minds. Within its walls scholars of all creeds delve deep into the secrets of the world. The marketplace bustles with the vibrant colors of imported wares and textiles, while the town square becomes a stage for festivals that honor art and the spirit of creativity. Yet, beneath this tranquil exterior, a world of mysteries awaits within the woods and cliffs that surround the city, enticing adventurers and explorers. At the top of the highest cliff of the surrounding hills is a magical spring that flows into and endows the river moving through the valley with minor constitution fortifying properties. The sick and elderly will make pilgrimages up the stream that feeds into the river to drink from falls closer to the source in hopes of curing their ailments. However those that journey higher up the mountain seldom make it to the summit. It is rumored that atop the mountain sleeps a shimmering frog-like beast who’s life stretches back to when the mountains were young. Those who claim to have met this beast say that it spoke to them of these ancient times and explained secrets of the world. Many university students, enthralled by this legend, attempt the journey, but seldom make it even a fraction of the way up as the path is beset by hazards and monsters strengthened by drinking from the stream."

    "text": "Veridia College of Arcane Science and the Arts\nThe College that draws so many tourists to the town is not only an architectural marvel, but a thriving center of scientific and arcane research. While practitioners of magic are not uncommon, the main purpose of their study is to understand and find ways to use both magic and science together to better the lives of their neighbors. This has seen application most notably in the clay mines. By utilizing natural magic they coax tree roots to act as scaffolding, they use evocations to light the pits at night, and healing magic to mend the bones of the laborers. Their research has turned what was previously the backbreaking labor of surfs into a worthwhile and comfortable career for those interested in sweating their brow. This sort of investment in the community allows for those who live here to spend their free time creating art, and pursuing other activities than the bare minimum to survive."

    "text": "River Veridia\nThis small river is the lifeblood of this town. River Veridia is infused with spring water from the peak of Mount Goldara which gives it minor fortifying properties. This passive magic in the water makes for hearty, adventurous folk who take challenges in stride as they know that they are likely to heal well and quickly with a bit of rest. The magic has little effect on passers through apart from feeling well rested for the path ahead, but for those who live their lives drinking from the stream it is the lifeblood of the community. There are many celebrations of the stream and it’s influence can be seen throughout the history of the town. Early battles for land are won through inexplicable feats of heroism, construction is done at lightning speed, and more technological innovation comes out of this city than anywhere else in the region. Many of the King’s advisors spend considerable time with the scholars of this town, and royalty has partnered with the town for export of the water for generations. Unfortunately for those who live down stream, and for the monarchy who imports it by the barrel, the river loses it’s fortifying properties over time so few outside of Veridia benefit from the magic. Even without it’s magic many with connections to the town carry the water with them in small pendants out of reverence for nature’s gift and all that it brings."

Over time this project becomes more difficult as the city expands, so each year sub challenges are issues such as “most inventive construction”, “Crowd favorite”, and “Constructed from the most exotic materials”.\n\n\nRun of the Alpacas\nWhile most are characteristically black, white and brown, a special breed of Alpaca is raised in and around Veridia that bears pastel shades of wool ranging from pale blue to lavender! These colorful Alpacas are led through the streets by their caretakers as a celebration of the textiles made from their fur, and advanced animal husbandry required to raise them."

While the planet does have magnetic poles, the Ley lines that invisibly criss-cross the world interfere with traditional compasses. A special kind of vision is required to see and follow the Ley lines between landmasses and ports. The traders partner with the Fleshwarpers to provide implants that allow their navigators to direct their ships. There are artifacts that can visualize Ley lines, and clerics of Ultheria are also able to navigate these seas, however for the apolitical and a-religious organization of the traders it is more sustainable to rely on bio augmentation.\n\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nDo not get involved in local politics\nDo not trade where you are not welcome\nDo not allow your own ethics to get in the way of the right deal\nDo not trade in slaves\nDo not trade with slavers\nDo not arm your vessel with weapons"

# What are the most important things to know when switching from 5e?
## Bounded Accuracy
::: {.incremental}
- In 5e you could do anything if you were lucky enough
- In pathfinder if you bite off more than you can chew you might fail every check and miss every attack with 0 chance of success.
  - Generally you will still have a chance fighting things AT MOST 4 levels higher than you
:::

## Advantage and Disadvantage?

::: {.incremental}
- Advantage/Disadvantage = Circumstance Bonus/Penalty
  - Using Raise a Shield with a buckler grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC
  - Being behind cover grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC
  - Sickened condition –2 status penalty
  - etc.

:::

## Circumstance Bonus
A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source.

## Contested Checks?
::: {.incremental}
- No contested checks!
  - e.g. Grapple is an Athletics check against the target's Fortitude DC
- Your Skill DC is equal to 10 + your bonus

:::

## Tiers of Success/Failure
::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
- Critical Success
  - Success with Natural 20, or exceed DC by 10+
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
- Success
  - Meet or exceed DC
- Failure
  - Below DC
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
- Critical Failure
  - Failure with a Natural 1, or 10+ below D
:::

## Tiers of Success/Failure
Different Checks have different outcomes depending on success level.

## Natural 20 and Natural 1
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
A NAT 20 IS NOT GUARANTEED SUCCESS
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-out}
A NAT 1 IS NOT GUARANTEED FAILURE
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
What these rolls DO is increase or decrease your success level by 1
:::

## Proficiency Rank {.center}
| Proficiency Rank | Proficiency Bonus |
|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
|    Untrained     |         0         |
|     Trained      |  Your level + 2   |
|      Expert      |  Your level + 4   |
|      Master      |  Your level + 6   |
|    Legendary     |  Your level + 8   |

## Task Difficulty {.center}

|Task Difficulty|Simple DC|
|:-:|:-:|
|Untrained|10|
|Trained|15|
|Expert|20|
|Master|30|
|Legendary|40|

## Initiative
- PERCEPTION is most frequently the skill used for initiative
  - Nearly all creatures are at least trained in Perception
- The GM will occasionally call for other skills to be used though!
  - If you are avoiding notice during exploration before combat you instead roll stealth
  - If combat came after a social encounter you may use Deception or Diplomacy to roll initiative
  
## Who Gets to Make Attacks of Opportunity?
- An attack of opportunity is ONLY granted to certain classes and is not a given.
- The step action allows you to move 5ft. and avoid an atack of opportunity   
  - There is no disengage in pathfinder
  
## How is Armor Class Calculated? {.center}
::: {.centerbody}
Armor Class = 

10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your armor’s Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor’s item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties
:::

## Saving Throws
- There are only 3 saving throws in Pathfinder 2e
  - Fortitude
    - allow you to reduce the effects of abilities and afflictions that can debilitate the body
  - Reflex
    - how well you can respond quickly to a situation and how gracefully you
can avoid effects that have been thrown at you
  - Will
    - how well you can resist attacks to your mind and spirit

## Fortitude {.center}
::: {.centerbody}
Fortitude save result = 

d20 roll + Constitution modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
:::

## Reflex {.center}
::: {.centerbody}
Reflex save result = 

d20 roll + Dexterity modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
:::

## Will {.center}
::: {.centerbody}
Will save result = 
d20 roll + Wisdom modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties
:::

# Downtime
## Downtime
In downtime, you can sum up the important events of a whole day with just one roll. Use this mode when the characters return home or otherwise aren’t adventuring.

Some examples of things you can do in downtime are:

- Craft (Crafting)
- Earn Income (Crafting, Lore, Performance)
- Treat Disease (Medicine)
- Create Forgery (Society)
- Subsist (Society, Survival)

## How Long Is Down Time?
Time Scale: Downtime can last days, weeks, months, or years in the game world in a few minutes of real time.

## Playing out a day of down time
- Most activities will have a simple roll, while others might initiate exploration or combat as necessary
- In down time not every character may be present or even in the same city! This can result in a player having to take a break while another player's down time is resolved

## Cost of Living {.center}
::: {.centerbody}
During long stretches of downtime you might need to spend money to survive.
:::

|Standard of Living|Week|Month|Year|
|:-:|:-:|
|Subsistence*|4 sp|2 gp|24 gp|
|Comfortable|1 gp|4 gp|52 gp|
|Fine	|30 gp|130 gp|1,600 gp|
|Extravagant|100 gp|430 gp|5,200 gp|

::: {.centerbody}
* You can attempt to Subsist using Society or Survival for free.
:::

# Exploration
A host of activities can be done during exploration! Generally these are actions that take around 10 minutes to complete, but can also include actions such as 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Cover Tracks
- Repair
- Scout
- Sense Direction
- Track
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Avoid Notice
- Hustle
- Search
- Treat Wounds
- and many more
:::
::::

## Treat Wounds
::: {.incremental}
Only one character really needs to invest in this as you can only be affected by 1 Treat Wounds, regardless of who is treating you, per hour.

- Any character class trained in Medicine can Treat Wounds
  - Generally this heals 2d8 hp in 10 minutes. 
  - You may attempt one use per hour, so multiple hours can heal multiple times. 
:::

## Be a Better Medic
::: {.incremental}
- With the Battle Medicine skill feat you gain a once per person per day one action heal that works exactly like treat wounds.
- The Ward Medic skill feat allows you to use treat wounds on more people during the 10 minute down time.
- Continual Recovery allows more frequent uses of Tread Wounds turning the hour wait between attempts on a single creature to 10 minutes. 
- Assurance at 3rd level and later allows you to always succeed on the roll.
:::

## Resting {auto-animate=true}
- Characters require 8 hours of sleep each day
  - The 8 hours of rest do not need to be consecutive
  - A character can gain the benefits of resting only once every 24 hours
- You regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) multiplied by your level. 
  - If you rest without any shelter or comfort, this may reduce healing by half (to a minimum of 1 HP)
- You lose the fatigued condition
You reduce the severity of the doomed and drained conditions by 1

## Resting {auto-animate=true}
- Most spell casters need to rest before they regain their spells for the day
- If a character goes more than 16 hours without going to sleep, they become fatigued.

## Watches and Rests {.center}
::: {.centerbody}
Adventuring parties usually put a few people on guard to watch out for danger while the others rest. Spending time on watch also interrupts sleep, so a night’s schedule needs to account for everyone’s time on guard duty.
:::

| Party Size|Total Time|Duration of Each Watch|
|:-:|:-:|
|2|16 hours|8 |hours|
|3|12 hours|4 hours|
|4|10 hours, 40 minutes|2 hours, 40 minutes|
|5|10 hours|2 hours|
|6|9 hours, 36 minutes|1 hour, 36 minutes|

# Combat
## What types of actions are there? {auto-animate=true}
::: {.incremental}
- Action
- Reaction
- Free Action
:::

  - Etc.
- Reaction
  - Recognize Spell
  - Grab an Edge

## How many actions do i get? {.center}
::: {.centerbody}
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
::: {.fragment .grow}
You get 3 actions
:::
:::
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
This includes Stride (movement)
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Also one free action and a reaction...
:::
:::

## Why wouldnt I just strike 3 times?
- The second strike incurs a -5 penalty
- the third incurs a -10 penalty!
- Some classes grant Maneuvers that allow more than one attack per action

# Combat Actions that work much differently in Pathfinder
## Shields
Shields do not passively increase AC

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Raise Shield is an action on your turn
  - Adds the shield's bonus to your AC until the next round
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Shield Block
  - Reduces damage from a physical attack by the raised shield's hardiness and both you and the shield lose that amount of health
:::
::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- Shield's have health and must be repaired
:::

## Flanking
Flanking catches an enemy Off-Guard inflicting a –2 circumstance penalty to their AC

## How do I flank?
::: {.incremental}
- To flank a foe, you and your ally must be on opposite sides of the creature
  - A line drawn between the center of your space and the center of your ally's space must pass through opposite sides or opposite corners of the foe's space.
  - both you and the ally have to be able to act
  - you must be wielding melee weapons or be able to make an unarmed attack
Continued...
:::

## How do I flank?
::: {.incremental}
  - you can't be under any effects that prevent you from attacking
  - you must both have the enemy within reach
    - If you are wielding a reach weapon, you use your reach with that weapon for this purpose."
:::

# Detection

## Line of sight
::: {.incremental}
- Maps matter more than 5e
- A hob goblin might be able to hide behind a tree, but a medium size gelatinous cube hiding behind that same tree would not be able to hide
- cover matters
- vision matters
:::

## Flat Checks
A flat check is a check where you roll a d20 and add and subtract nothing to/from it

## Imprecise senses
Hearing, Smell, etc.

## Hidden
::: {.incremental}
- While you're hidden from a creature, that creature knows the space you're in but can't tell precisely where you are.
  - When a Seeking creature uses only imprecise senses, the hidden creature remains hidden, rather than observed.
- A creature you're hidden from is **Off-Guard** to you, and it must succeed at a DC 11 flat check when targeting you with an attack, spell, or other effect or it fails to affect you. Area effects aren't subject to this flat check.
:::

## Undetected {auto-animate=true}
When you are undetected by a creature, that creature cannot see you at all, has no idea what space you occupy, and can't target you.

- A creature you're hidden from is **Off-Guard** to you

## Undetected {auto-animate=true}
::: {.incremental}
- you still can be affected by abilities that target an area. When you're undetected by a creature, that creature is off-guard to you.
- A creature you're undetected by can guess which square you're in to try targeting you. 
  - It must pick a square and attempt an attack
- A creature can use the Seek action to try to find you.
  - When a Seeking creature uses only imprecise senses, the hidden creature becomes hidden, rather than observed if found.
:::

## Undetected {auto-animate=true}
Undetected USUALLY only comes into play at the start of combat if you were using **Avoid Notice** during the exploration phase or if an enemy went under your radar

## Attacking an undetected creature
- This may happen in a situation where the creature may be invisible and undetectable with imprecise senses
- This works like targeting a hidden creature (requiring a DC 11 flat check), but the flat check and attack roll are rolled in secret by the GM, who doesn't reveal whether the attack missed due to failing the flat check, failing the attack roll, or choosing the wrong square.

## Concealed
- "This condition protects a creature if it’s in mist, within dim light, or amid something else that obscures sight but does not provide a physical barrier to effects. An effect or type of terrain that describes an area of concealment makes all creatures within it concealed."
- When you target a creature that’s concealed from you, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check before you roll to determine your effect. If you fail, you don’t affect the target. The concealed condition doesn’t change which of the main categories of detection apply to the creature.

## Stealth in Combat
::: {.incremental}
- Hiding is contested by enemy perception DC
- Sneak is an action that allows you to move at half speed and remain hidden after successfully hiding
- point out is an action that lets you draw other team mates attention to a hiding enemy that you can see
- Attacking an enemy that you are hidden from catches them **Off-Guard** which inflicts a –2 circumstance penalty to their AC
:::

# Death and Dying
## NPCs
::: {.incremental}
- Creatures cannot be reduced to fewer than 0 Hit Points
- When most creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they die and are
removed from play unless the attack was nonlethal, in which
case they are instead knocked out for a significant amount
of time (usually 1 minute or more)
- When undead and construct creatures reach 0 Hit Points, they are destroyed
:::

## Players
- Player characters, their companions, and other significant characters and creatures don’t automatically die when they reach 0 Hit Points Instead, they are knocked out and are at risk of death
- If the damage was dealt by a nonlethal attack or nonlethal effect, you don’t gain the dying condition; you are instead unconscious with 0 Hit Points.

## Knocked out and Dying

::: {.incremental}
- You immediately move your initiative position to directly before the turn in which you were reduced to 0 HP
- You gain the dying 1 condition
  - If the effect that knocked you out was a critical success from the attacker or the result of your critical failure, you gain the dying 2 condition instead
  - If you have the wounded condition increase your dying value by an amount equal to your wounded value
:::
## Knocked out and Dying

::: {.incremental}
- If you take damage while you already have the dying condition, increase your dying condition value by 1, or by 2 if the damage came from an attacker’s critical hit or your own critical failure
:::

## Dying
::: {.incremental}
- Dying always includes a value. If this value ever reaches dying 4, you die
- If you’re dying, you must attempt a recovery check at the start of your turn each round to determine whether you get better or worse.
- If you lose the dying condition by succeeding at a recovery check and are still at 0 Hit Points, you remain unconscious, but you can wake up after a minimum of 10 minutes but up to several hours
:::

## Dying
::: {.incremental}
- If you receive healing during this time, you lose the unconscious condition and can act normally on your next turn.
:::

## Wounded
::: {.incremental}
- Anytime you lose the dying condition, you gain the wounded 1 condition, or increase your wounded value by 1 if you already have that condition
- If you gain the dying condition while wounded, increase the dying
condition’s value by your wounded value.
- The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with Treat Wounds, or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.
:::

## Doomed
- Doomed always includes a value
- The maximum dying value at which you die is reduced by your doomed value
- If your maximum dying value is ever reduced to 0, you instantly die
- Your doomed value decreases by 1 each time you get a full night’s rest

# Hero Points
## Gaining Hero Points
- Usually, each character gets 1 Hero Point at the start of a session and can gain more later by performing heroic deeds
- You can have a maximum of 3 Hero Points at a time, and you lose any remaining Hero Points at the end of a session'

## Using Hero Points {auto-animate=true}
- You can spend a Hero Point on yourself or on behalf of your familiar or animal companion.
- You can spend your Hero Points in one of two ways

## Using Hero Points {auto-animate=true}
::: {.incremental}
- Spend 1 Hero Point to re-roll a check. You must use the second result and can only do this once per check
- Spend all your Hero Points (minimum 1) to avoid death
  - You can do this when your dying condition would increase
  - You lose the dying condition entirely and stabilize with 0 Hit Points
  - You don’t gain the wounded condition or increase its value from losing the dying condition in this way, but if you already had that condition, you don’t lose it or decrease its value.
:::

## Describing Heroic Deeds
Because spending Hero Points reflects heroic deeds or tasks that surpass normal expectations, if you spend a Hero Point, you should describe the deed or task your character accomplishes with it to the other players
